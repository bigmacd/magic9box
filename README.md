# magic9box
A helpful tool for backlog refinement

Sometimes an independent third party is needed to resolve stalemates when refining the backlog.  This tool will help.  Or not.  

Magic 9 Box is an agile oriented random comment generator that can run on an Arduino Pro Mini, an ADXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer, an a I2C 1602 16x2 Serial LCD Display.  It's just for fun, and the "random" comments included in the source code are specific to my team.  But since you have to build this anyway, you can substitute your own witty comments (16 characters per line max).
